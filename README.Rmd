This is README file for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.  The following R script, run_analysis.R, completes the following:

1. Downloads the dataset if it is not already in the working directory
2. Loads the related file information into the variables
3. Read the variable names
4. Merges the two datasets
5. The data was subsetted for mean and standard deviation
6. The `Activity` and `Subject` columns were converted into factors
7. A tidy dataset is created that consists of the average (mean) value of each
   variable for each subject and activity pair
8. The script outputs tidydata.txt
